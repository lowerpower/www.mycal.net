  "description": "A cannabis strain bred in Petaluma, CA using chicken coop compost ('coop-born gold') as the growing medium — the name is literal, not metaphorical. Developed through years of backyard breeding, crossing Guava Cookie with Clearlake fire-stressed Chili Verde genetics, the strain became a local legend distributed through a gift economy rather than sold. The seeds carry the lineage forward.",
