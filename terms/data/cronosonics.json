  "description": "A hybrid format pairing written essays with companion songs designed to distill, reinforce, and encode ideas into memory through dual-channel processing. From Greek chronos (time — persistence of an idea) and sonus (sound — the musical layer). Not background music — active reinforcement devices. The essay explains; the song makes you remember.",
