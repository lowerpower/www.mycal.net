  "description": "The state of being not-quite-right — functional but degraded, broken but still limping along, or done in a wrong or stupid way. A bike wheel rubbing every rotation is kajingen. A tape-repaired sole flapping with every step is kajingen. A person doing something half-assed is kajingen. Broader than 'janky' — covers objects, repairs, and human behavior alike. Predates and parallels modern usage of 'janky' by decades.",
